R grammer of sql BNF: string => productions
R check on grammer: serach condition

R auto link production -> class

- date support
- datetime support
- float number support

F INTO OUTFILE '/path/to/file.csv'
- paren support in search condition

F column alias
- table alias
- add parser error handler


JOIN related:
- multiple table support

R different return value of visit()

DONE
----
R better grammer definition: | for multiple productions

F limit x
F per key order by DESC | ASC (__lt__, etc.)
F row class ordering
- order by

- having with function result support (search condition bind to table)
- simple having support
- group by without aggregate func func
- group by multiple columns

R remove table expr
R select core -> selete statments (rename)
- simple group by

- select_list => column, count(column)
- select_list => func(c1), func(c2)

- agg func: sum
- agg func: avg
- agg func: count, select_list => count(column)

- * support
I better __repr__ support (for debug)
R refactor tests
R folder structure: syntax

- multiple conditions: not
- comparator: like
- multiple conditions: and
- multiple conditions: or

- Query.execute() should return a new table (for subquery)
- add data type to table definition
- add map process for value coercion
- comparator: <, <=, >, >=
- string support

- [R] emtpy -> empty-where ?

- split productions into modules
- add fabric file: test commands, autopep8
- string comparation
- select hmultiple result columns
